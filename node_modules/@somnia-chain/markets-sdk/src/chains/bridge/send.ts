// The one RPC-touching file in the bridge module: sign a planner transaction
// locally and broadcast it over Somnia's realtime_sendRawTransaction — which
// blocks server-side and returns the RECEIPT in the same call, so a bridge
// transaction confirms in ONE round-trip instead of send-then-poll.
//
// Same latency doctrine as the SDK's trading write path (trade.ts): fees are
// FIXED (never estimated), gas is a fixed generous ceiling, and the raw tx goes
// out in a single request. Two deliberate differences, because bridging is not
// a hot path: the nonce is fetched per call (no local nonce cache to corrupt),
// and the realtime → eth_sendRawTransaction fallback is probed per call rather
// than cached (a one-off send has no fleet of writes to amortize a probe over).
//
// A LOCAL signer is required: realtime_sendRawTransaction takes a raw SIGNED
// transaction, and a browser extension will not sign one for you — injected
// wallets expose eth_sendTransaction, not raw signing. For that path, see
// toEip1193Transaction and the walkthrough's browser section.

/**

 *  executed and answers with the receipt, so send + confirm is a single
 *  round-trip. On a node without the method (anvil, stock geth) it falls back
 *  to `eth_sendRawTransaction` + a receipt wait, so the same code runs against
 *  `somniaLocal`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { BridgeToken, ChainId, createBridgeTransfer, sendBridgeStep } from "@somnia-chain/markets-sdk/chains";
 *
 * const plan = createBridgeTransfer({
 *   token: BridgeToken.WBTC,
 *   from: ChainId.somniaShannon,
 *   to: ChainId.hidekiTestnet,
 *   amount: 100_000_000n, // 1 WBTC — 8 decimals, not 18
 *   recipient: account.address,
 * });
 *
 * if (plan.approveStep) await sendBridgeStep(client, plan.approveStep, { account });
 * const receipt = await sendBridgeStep(client, plan.bridgeStep, { account });
 * receipt.status; // "success" — a reverted receipt throws instead
 * ```
 *
 *  Each call resolves only once its transaction is CONFIRMED, so the
 *  approve-then-bridge ordering above is safe by construction. Fees and gas are
 *  fixed, never estimated — the same doctrine as the SDK's trading writes.
 *
 *  @param client A public client for the transaction's chain (its `request` is the wire).
 *  @param step The planner transaction — `plan.approveStep` / `plan.bridgeStep`.
 *  @param options The local signer, plus optional gas/fee overrides.
 *  @returns The mined receipt, status `"success"`.
 *  @throws If the client is on a different chain than the step, if the node
 *   rejects the transaction, or if the receipt says `"reverted"` — the message
 *   names the step's `description`.
