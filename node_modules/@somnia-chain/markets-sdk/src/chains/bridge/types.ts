// Bridge types + one enumeration: which tokens can cross. (Which networks they
// cross between is `ChainId`, which lives with the chain definitions in
// `../chainId` — every Somnia network has a chain id; only some are bridged.)
//
// ENUM STYLE: `const` objects paired with a same-named type, not TS `enum`s.
// That is the pattern this package uses everywhere (`BinarySide`, `MarketType`,
// `PriceCandleResolution`) and it is the one that survives `isolatedModules` +
// TS's erasable-syntax direction: a TS `enum` emits a runtime object that can't
// be erased and doesn't tree-shake. You still get enum ergonomics —
// `BridgeToken.WBTC` for the value, `BridgeToken` for the type — plus plain
// string/number literals work as arguments, which a real enum forbids.
