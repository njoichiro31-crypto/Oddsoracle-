// The bridge wrapper: (token, from, to, amount) → the unsigned transactions that

//
// PURE. No RPC, no signer, no client — everything needed is in the registry, so a
// plan can be built offline, in a server action, or inside a Safe proposal. What
// comes back is transaction data; signing, fees, nonce and gas stay with whoever
// sends it.
//
// The encodings here are not inferred from documentation: `transferRemote`
// (selector 0x81b4e8b4) was simulated against the live routers on both chains with
// `eth_call` — `value = amount` on the native route returns a real message id,
// while `value = 0`, a missing ERC-20 approval, and an unenrolled destination each
// revert. test/bridge.test.ts pins the calldata byte-for-byte.

 *
 *  On a Somnia node, {@link sendBridgeStep} does the same in one round-trip per

 *  (hex quantities throughout), with only `from`/`to`/`data`/`value` set. Every
 *  field is a hex string, so the result survives `JSON.stringify`, a server →
 *  browser boundary, or a `postMessage` — which a raw {@link BridgeTransaction}
 *  does not: its `value` is a `bigint`, and `JSON.stringify` throws on bigints.
 *
 *  What it deliberately DROPS is as important as what it converts:

 *    wallet signs on its **active** chain. Switch first with
 *    `wallet_switchEthereumChain` (using the transaction's `chainId`) or it
 *    goes out on whatever network the wallet happens to be on.
 *  - `description` — a UI label, not a transaction field; some wallets reject
 *    requests carrying unknown keys.
 *
 *  No `gas`, no nonce, no fees, same as the input: the wallet estimates and
 *  fills those. Callers on viem don't need this at all —
 *  `walletClient.sendTransaction({ ...plan.bridgeStep, account })` takes it
 *  as-is; this exists for the raw `provider.request(...)` path and for moving a
