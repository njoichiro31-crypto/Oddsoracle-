 *  Somnia testnet — **Elwood** (chain id `50313`, network id `50313`), the

 *  100 ms blocks and **STT** as the native token, same as Shannon.
 *
 *  No public block explorer and no Multicall3 deployment are known for Elwood, so
 *  neither field is set — a `multicall: true` read against this chain falls back
 *  to individual `eth_call`s instead of pointing at an address that has no code.
