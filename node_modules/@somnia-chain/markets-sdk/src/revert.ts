// Revert decoding — turns whatever a node/viem hands back for a failed call into
// a {@link ContractRevertError} that names the Solidity error.
//
// This is the ONE place that knows the shape of a viem/JSON-RPC failure. Callers
// (the send path in trade.ts, the read helpers) hand it the caught value and get
// back an SDK error; they never inspect `e.cause.data` themselves. Keeping that
// knowledge here is what lets errors.ts stay a pure vocabulary module.
//
// Every path yields a ContractRevertError — a matched custom error, a bare
// require string, unrecognized data, or no data at all (see the fallbacks in
// `decodeRevert`). A caller therefore never has to handle a raw viem error to
// find out why a call failed.
