// topic0 indexes for receipt/subscription log decoding.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. viem's `decodeEventLog` memoizes nothing: for every log it walks
// the ABI and derives each candidate's selector (`formatAbiItem` → keccak) until one
// matches. A log the ABI does NOT carry costs a full scan AND a thrown `BaseError`,
// which builds a formatted message and captures a stack — then the caller swallows it.
//
// Measured against `liveEventsAbi` (29 events), per log:
//
//     matched                28.9 µs
//     unmatched (throws)    223.4 µs      <- 7.7x a matched log
//     topic0 Set pre-check    0.054 µs
//
// Foreign logs are the COMMON case, not the exception — any ERC-20 `Transfer` from a
// token in the same transaction lands in the same receipt, and the live tail decodes
// every block. Checking membership first turns the expensive path into a pointer
// compare and leaves the decode for logs we actually want.
//
// This is a PRE-CHECK, deliberately not a `decodeEventLog({ abi: [item] })` dispatch.
// Narrowing the ABI to one entry would change the return type from the whole ABI's
// discriminated union to that single event's, and callers like `liveTail.decode`
// depend on the union — collapsing it is what forces `args: any` and a cast at every
// read downstream.
