// The BINARY_V1 market-type plugin — the first (today only) entry in the
// MarketTypePlugin registry. It wires the existing operatorReads fee-param
// helpers (`encodeBinaryVenueFeeParams` / `decodeBinaryVenueFeeParams`) plus the
// machinery onboarding steps a binary up/down market needs: stamp a
// MarketCreator (+ policy) bound to the protocol OracleHub, fund it, then
// register a rolling series. (Oracle v2 removed the per-operator adapter step —
// there is nothing to mint or arm; the hub is the one approved adapter.)
// A future market type slots in as a sibling plugin — the registry, the admin
// surfaces, and the preflight are all keyed by `marketType`, not hardcoded to
// binary. It lives in ITS kind's directory (this one is binary/), and
// marketTypes/ stays the pure registry: index.ts aggregates NAMES at compile
// time, the registry aggregates KINDS at runtime, one line each per kind.
