// Keyed async memoization — the one shape behind the SDK's per-key chain-read
// and watch caches, extracted so each site stops hand-rolling the same three
// lines (and the same two subtleties) around a Map<K, Promise<V>>.
//
// The subtleties this owns:
//
// 1. The PROMISE is cached, not the value, and it goes into the map before the
//    work settles — so concurrent callers for one key share a single in-flight
//    request instead of stampeding (quotes fire per keystroke; each would
//    otherwise start its own eth_call on a cold key).
// 2. A rejection evicts the entry, so a transient failure is retried by the
//    next caller instead of being served from cache forever. Eviction checks
//    the entry still holds THIS promise — after an external delete() and
//    re-create, a stale rejection must not tear down its replacement.
//
// NOT this shape: liveTail/priceFeed `hydrations`, which delete on settle
// (success too) — those dedup in-flight work only, they don't memoize.
