// The OracleHub surface (Oracle v2, DESIGN §8e — EARMARK-AT-CREATION). There is
// ONE governance-approved adapter, the OracleHub: it deduplicates question
// scheduling content-addressed (same template definition → same question id,
// charged only marginal cost), EARMARKS the resolution reserve per market at
// onBind (attached with the market-creation value, LOCKED so resolution funds
// are always present, never withdrawable while the market is live), debits the
// EXACT metered resolve cost against that earmark at resolution, credits any
// surplus (`reserve − charged`) to the operator's WITHDRAWABLE credit, and
// delivers answers as payout vectors.
//
// USER-SIDE QUOTE RULE (§8e): the create-market native value is now
//   `getSchedulingCost(def) + resolveReserve()`
// — the reserve is ATTACHED to the create (forwarded to onBind and locked); there
// is NO standing prepaid balance / deposit pre-fund anymore. {@link
// quoteCreateMarketValue} returns exactly that sum (excess is refunded in-tx).
// The operator's owner can later withdraw only the accrued surplus credit
// ({@link withdrawableOf}) via credit-only `withdraw`.
//
// Reads are standalone (no signer: subject, hub, client); writes live on the
// {@link OracleHubAdmin} built via `client.createOracleHubAdmin(config)` —
// same signer doctrine as the other machinery admins (makeMachineryWriter).
