// Market-order quoting over a unified (human-unit) book — the presentation
// plane's "what will this order actually do" math, upstreamed from the
// DreamDex web app so every consumer frontend doesn't hand-roll it.
//
// Everything here is PURE and kind-neutral by construction: it operates on
// [price, amount][] levels, so it serves spot books, perp books, and binary
// outcome books alike (feed it the tradable's lensed view). What it does NOT
// know about is the cost semantics of the order that follows — a spot buy
// escrows quote, a perp buy locks margin — which stay with the per-kind
// write paths.
