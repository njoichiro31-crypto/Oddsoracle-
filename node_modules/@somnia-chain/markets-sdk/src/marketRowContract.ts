// Compile-time contract between the WIRE row and the PUBLIC market types.

// `toMarket` builds a per-variant object, taking required type-specific columns
// with `?? unreachable(...)` because GraphQL cannot express that `marketType`
// correlates with which nullable columns are populated. That assertion is
// necessary — but on its own it also erases a failure this change exists to catch:
// a field that still EXISTS in the schema but changed TYPE (say `asset` String →
// Int) regenerates cleanly and typechecks, silently making the public type a lie.
//
// So the correlation stays asserted, while every field's NAME and WIRE TYPE is
// pinned here. These are type-level only — no runtime cost, nothing exported from
// the package. A mismatch is a compile error naming the field.
//
// On failure: the schema changed. Update the public type in markets.ts to match the
// new wire type (or fix the fragment if the field was renamed), then adjust the
// mapping if the change is more than cosmetic.

// The ASSERTED set — which fields `toMarket` claims the indexer always populates.
//
// The two checks above deliberately strip nullability, so neither notices the
// class of drift that actually reaches users: a column the indexer STOPS always
// writing. `toMarket` takes each required variant column with `?? unreachable()`,
// and that assertion is only as good as the handler that upholds it — if a field
// becomes conditional upstream, nothing here would have complained and the throw
// would surface as a dropped row (list reads) or a failed fetch (single reads).
//
// So the set is pinned by NAME below. A field that is required on the public
// variant but nullable on the wire IS an asserted field, by construction — that
// is exactly the gap `?? unreachable()` bridges — so the compiler can derive the
// set and diff it against the expectation. The list cannot drift silently:
//
//   - make a public field optional / add a nullable one  → it leaves the set
//   - make a public field required (new assertion)       → it enters the set
//
// Either way the diff fails to compile and names the field. Editing the list is
// then a deliberate act: the claim is that `indexer/src/handlers/{binary,spot,
// perp}.ts` writes that column UNCONDITIONALLY at row creation. Verify against the
// handler before adding a name, and prefer making the public field optional over
// asserting a field the indexer only usually writes.
