/**
 *  Funding-rate normalization.
 *
 *  The one thing to understand before reading a perp funding rate: it is a **per
 *  calculation-window** fraction, not a per-interval one and not an annual one. Every
 *  rate this SDK surfaces — `PerpState.fundingRate`, `FundingRateUpdate.fundingRate`,
 *  the raw values on chain — is scaled to `fundingWindowSec`, which is 28800 (8h) on
 *  every live pool.
 *
 *  Each settlement interval accrues `rate / n` of it, where
 *
 *  ```
 *  n = fundingWindowSec / fundingIntervalSec
 *  ```
 *
 *  `n` is **96** on testnet (28800 / 300) and expected to be **8** on mainnet
 *  (28800 / 3600). So the same emitted rate value means a **12x different**
 *  per-interval accrual between the two environments. That is why every row carries its
 *  own `fundingWindowSec` and why these helpers take it as an argument: hardcoding the
 *  denominator is the single most expensive mistake available here, and it produces a
 *  plausible-looking chart rather than an error.

 *
 *  Rollup candles are **sparse by construction**: a window touched by no settlement's
 *  covered span produces no row, because nothing triggered a write. A chart that plots
 *  the rows as-is silently closes those gaps and draws funding that never accrued.
 *
 *  This is the ONLY densification the presentation tier should do, and the constraint is
 *  as much about what it must not do:
 *
 *  - Missing slots are emitted as **zero** rate with **zero coverage** — never as a
 *    carry-forward of the previous rate. Carrying forward is the specific error the
 *    protocol docs call out: gaps are genuinely zero-funding intervals, and carrying the
 *    last rate through the 22h outage these pools actually had would fabricate ~2.6% of
 *    funding out of nothing.
 *  - It is not interpolation. Nothing is smoothed, and no real value is altered.
 *  - `coverage: "0"` is what lets a chart hatch or grey the slot rather than draw a zero
 *    that looks like a measurement. A filled slot and a genuinely-zero measured slot are
 *    different facts, and only `coverage` distinguishes them.
 *  - **It never fills slots older than the oldest row it was given.** This is the
 *    truncation guard, and it matters because `listFundingRateCandles` pages
 *    newest-first: 30 days of hourly buckets is 720 rows against a default `limit` of
 *    500, so a caller who asks for a month gets the newest 500 and no indication that
 *    anything was dropped. Filling the 220 missing older slots would render nine days as
 *    a funding pause that never happened — reintroducing exactly the ambiguity
 *    `coverage` exists to remove, one layer up. Refusing to invent them means the window
 *    can come back SHORTER than `[from, to)`: read the first element's `bucketStart`
 *    rather than assuming it equals `from`, and page with `offset` if you need the rest.
