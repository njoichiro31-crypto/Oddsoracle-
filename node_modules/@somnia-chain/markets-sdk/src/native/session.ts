// Session accounts, derived LOCALLY.
//
// A session is a 32-byte seed. The node turns that seed into a key pair and signs
// on your behalf (`somnia_sendSessionTransaction`) — but the derivation is public
// and deterministic, so the same address can be computed here with no RPC at all.
// That is worth having for three reasons: you can show a user their session address
// before any network call, you can pre-fund it offline, and — the important one —
// you can see plainly that **the seed is a private key in another shape**.
//
// LOCKSTEP: github.com/somnia-chain/somnia2 — `docs/session_transactions.md`
// (§"Key derivation") and `docs/generate-non-random-private-key.md`. Verified
// against a live Shannon node: seed `0x11…11` derives
// `0xd56d8c05aa8da0f3afd676aec94014e89af3cc51`, which is exactly what
// `somnia_getSessionAddress` returns for it. test/native.e2e.test.ts re-checks the
// two against each other on demand, which is the assertion that keeps this honest.
