 *  under manual vault mode, "how much must I deposit first?". `delta` is the same
 *  number in both readings: in auto-pull mode it is what the wallet will be pulled
 *  for; in manual mode it is the required pre-deposit (see `setManualVaultMode`, and

 *
 *  **Details**
 *
 *  `requiredAmount` is a worst-case envelope, not a quote: the pool prices it at
 *  `max(takerFee, makerFee) + builderFee`, since a single order is either crossed as
 *  taker or rested as maker but never both. An order that rests and later fills as
 *  maker consumes less.
 *
 *  @example Deposit exactly the shortfall, then place
 *  ```ts
 *  const need = await client.getAutoPullRequirement({ pool, owner, isBid: true, price: 1n, quantity: 1n });
 *  if (need.delta > 0n) {
 *    const trader = client.createTrader({ privateKey });
 *    await trader.depositVault({ vault: pool, token: need.inputToken, amount: need.delta });
